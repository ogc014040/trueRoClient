# Companion AI

This implementation is a portage of https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AzzyAI

A configurable AI for the Homunculus and Mercenary systems. It decides how the
companion targets, chases, attacks, casts skills, buffs, heals, and moves
relative to its owner. This document describes what the code actually does. Where
a configuration field exists but the engine does not yet act on it, that is
stated explicitly.

## Overview

The AI runs a small state machine per companion. Once per engine tick it takes a
snapshot of the world (the companion, the owner, and nearby actors) and returns a
list of intents (move, attack, cast a skill). The client turns those intents into
the same network packets a player would send.

The default configuration works without any changes. Every option is stored in a
JSON file and can be edited in-game.

Supported homunculus types are the four base classes and their evolutions:

- 1 Lif
- 2 Amistr
- 3 Filir
- 4 Vanilmirth
- 5 to 8 the evolved forms, which resolve to the same behavior as their base
  class using the type number modulo 4

Homunculus S classes are not supported. Their combo, grapple, minion, and mob
skills are not modelled.

## Architecture

The AI is a standalone crate, `ragnarok-ai`, that depends only on the shared data
models plus serde and tracing. It has no dependency on the network, renderer,
game, or UI crates. This keeps it usable from tools and testable in isolation.

The interface is a snapshot in and intents out:

- `AiContext` carries the per-tick world snapshot: the companion position, HP, SP,
  motion, attack range and attack speed, the companion type, the owner position,
  motion and HP, the list of nearby actors, the companion skill list, the active
  configuration values (`AiParams`), the tactics table, the PVP tactics table, and
  a function that classifies another actor as friend, enemy, and so on.
- `CompanionAi::tick` advances the state machine and returns `Vec<AiIntent>`.
- `AiIntent` is one of `MoveTo`, `MoveToOwner`, `Attack`, `SkillObject`,
  `SkillGround`, or `EmergencyDisconnect`.

The engine tick interval is 140 ms. The client feeds elapsed time each frame and
the engine steps the state machine in fixed 140 ms increments, capped so a long
stall cannot run many steps at once.

## Setup and configuration file

Configuration lives in `companion_ai.json` at the repository root, next to
`config.json`. It is loaded at startup and created with defaults if absent.

The file has these sections:

- `homunculus` object of homunculus options
- `mercenary` object of mercenary options
- `homunculus_tactics` array of per-mob tactic rows for the homunculus
- `mercenary_tactics` array of per-mob tactic rows for the mercenary
- `homunculus_pvp_tactics` array of PVP tactic rows for the homunculus
- `mercenary_pvp_tactics` array of PVP tactic rows for the mercenary
- `friends` map from account id to a friend class

Every field is optional. Missing fields self-heal to their default value when the
file is read, so a partial file is valid. This also means that once a file has
been saved, fields already present keep their saved value; new default tactics are
not merged into an existing saved tactics array. Use the Reset control in the
configuration window to adopt the current default tables.

Enum-valued options are stored as their integer value, so the JSON matches the
documented option numbers below.

## The in-game configuration window

Window id 3200. Open it by right-clicking the companion and choosing AI Settings,
or from the AI button on the homunculus window.

It has seven tabs:

- Homun homunculus options
- Merc mercenary options
- H.Tactics homunculus per-mob tactics editor
- M.Tactics mercenary per-mob tactics editor
- H.PVP homunculus PVP tactics
- M.PVP mercenary PVP tactics
- Extra shared controls

Option rows are checkboxes, integer steppers, or cycling enum selectors, grouped
under category headers. The tactics tabs show a row selector with add and delete
controls and one editable row of the thirteen tactic columns.

Save writes the current values to `companion_ai.json`. Revert reloads the file.
Reset restores the built-in defaults, including the full default tactic tables.

## Commanding a companion

Direct commands override the AI until they complete, then the AI resumes.

- Alt and right-click commands the homunculus, Alt and left-click commands the
  mercenary. Each binding is live only while that companion is out, so a player
  with both out drives them independently. An attackable target under the cursor
  becomes an attack order. Anything else is a move order to that cell.
- An armed pick, a patrol destination or a companion skill target, wins over the
  mercenary binding, so Alt and left-click resolves the pick instead of issuing a
  move order. The original has no armed picks and so has no equivalent rule.
- Holding Shift while issuing a command queues it as a reserved command. Reserved
  commands run after the current action finishes, in order, up to ten queued.
- Right-clicking the companion without Alt opens a context menu: Show Info, Feed
  (homunculus only), Stand By, Patrol, and AI Settings.
- Stand By puts the companion in a follow-and-hold state. It stops seeking
  targets and stays near the owner until the next command. Any command clears it.
- Ctrl and T toggles Stand By for the mercenary.

Patrol:

- The context-menu entry arms a destination pick. The next left-click on a cell
  starts the patrol, and the
  companion paces between the cell it was standing on and the clicked cell.
- A patrol is a standing order: the companion breaks off to engage targets the
  usual way, then goes back to pacing instead of returning to the owner. It
  ignores follow range for as long as the order stands.
- While a patrol stands, the aggro and reaction radii are measured from the
  companion rather than from the owner, so it picks up what it walks past. Every
  other state measures them from the owner.
- The context-menu entry reads Stop Patrol while a patrol is standing. Any other
  command, including Stand By and a plain move order, also ends it.

Casting a specific skill:

- Open the homunculus or mercenary skill window, select a skill, and press Use, or
  double-click the skill row.
- For a self or support skill the cast is issued immediately.
- For a target skill the cursor arms, and the next left-click on a target fires it.
- For a ground skill the next click on a cell fires it.

The command set understood by the engine is Move, Stop, Hold, Follow, Patrol,
Attack a target, Attack an area, cast a skill on a target, and cast a skill on the
ground.

## Friending other players

The `friends` section maps an account id to a friend class. The friend classifier
combines this map with the current party and the owner. Friend classes are:

- 1 Friend
- 2 Retainer
- 3 PK Friend
- 10 Neutral
- 11 Enemy
- 12 KoS
- 13 Ally

The owner, friends, and retainers are protected. A monster that a friend is
already fighting is picked up as a target through the friend-target scan, and a
monster that is fighting a non-friend player is left alone by kill-steal
protection. Friend classes also select which PVP tactic applies to a player when
PVP mode is on.

## Behavior by state

Idle, in this order:

1. Drain one reserved command if any is queued.
2. Clear berserk mode.
3. If avoidance is on and a dangerous monster is within aggro distance, retreat
   toward the owner.
4. Upkeep, gated by the global skill delay: heal if enabled and needed, then
   Amistr Castling if enabled and the owner is mobbed, then one self-buff whose
   configured timing matches the idle context.
5. If the owner is sitting and rest is allowed, stop seeking targets.
6. Otherwise select a target: a monster a friend is attacking, then an aggro or
   reaction target, then a tank target.
7. If a patrol order stands, resume pacing toward its current endpoint.
8. If no target and the owner is out of follow range, follow.
9. Otherwise, if idle-walk is on and the companion is healthy, wander near the
   owner.

Chase: move toward the target, drop it if it goes out of sight or becomes a
kill-steal, give up after repeated failure to close and mark it unreachable, and
optionally switch to a better opportunistic target. Enter attack when in range.

Attack: verify the target is alive and in range. Fire the offensive attack skill
if one is selected and its gates pass, otherwise melee. When in berserk mode, fire
a berserk-timed buff first if one is due. When dance-attack is enabled, circle one
cell around the target after the melee.

Tank and tank-chase: approach a tank-tactic monster and hit it periodically to
hold its attention when it is not already attacking the companion.

Follow: move to the owner until within follow range, then return to idle.

Emergency layer: before any state runs each tick, buffs configured for the ASAP
timing are applied in any state.

## Skills the AI uses

Offensive attack skills, cast automatically while attacking:

- Filir casts Moonlight
- Vanilmirth casts Caprice
- Lif and Amistr have no offensive attack skill and only melee
- A mercenary casts the first attack skill it has learned from this priority
  order: Double Strafe, Sharp Shooting, Pierce, Spiral Pierce, Bash. A mercenary
  that has learned none of these only melees.

Selection gates, all of which must pass:

- Use Attack Skill is on.
- The global auto skill delay since the last cast has elapsed.
- The tactic Skill Use column allows another cast on this target.
- The per-skill reuse cooldown has elapsed. Moonlight is 2000 ms. Caprice is
  2000 ms plus 200 ms per level.
- SP minus the reserve is at least the skill cost.
- The skill range reaches the target.

The cast level and SP cost come from the live server skill list, so a skill must
be learned to be used.

Cast-fail detection: after an auto-cast the engine watches the result. SP being
consumed or a visible cast motion counts as success. No sign within 1500 ms counts
as a failure, which clears the cooldown so the cast is retried, capped at two
retries per engagement and reset when the target changes. The wider timeout and
the hard cap exist because SP and motion updates arrive over the network with lag.

Buffs, cast on self while idle by default. Each is re-cast when its duration
lapses:

- Homunculus offensive: Lif Mental Charge, Amistr Bloodlust, Filir Flitting
- Homunculus defensive: Lif Urgent Escape, Amistr Bulwark, Filir Accelerated
  Flight
- Mercenary offensive: Quicken
- Mercenary defensive: the first learned of Auto Guard, Parrying, Reflect Shield

Healing:

- Lif casts its heal on the owner when the owner drops below the owner heal
  percent
- Vanilmirth casts Chaotic Blessing on itself when it drops below the self heal
  percent

Castling: an Amistr with Castle Defend enabled casts Castling on the owner to swap
places and tank when the number of monsters attacking the owner reaches the
threshold.

## Configuration reference

Every field in the `homunculus` and `mercenary` sections, with its default value,
status, and purpose.

The Status column is one of:

- Active: the engine reads this field, so changing it changes behavior.
- Reserved: the field exists in the config file, and usually in the in-game window,
  so it can be set and is saved, but the engine does not read it yet, so setting it
  has no effect. Reserved fields are kept for layout compatibility with the
  reference AI and as room for future behavior. Do not rely on them doing anything.

Defaults shown are the homunculus defaults. Differences in the mercenary section
are noted at the end.

### Mercenary section differences

The mercenary section shares the same field names and defaults for the options
above, except that it omits the homunculus-only fields: the heal thresholds and
UseAutoHeal, the Castling fields, the per-buff level overrides, the Homunculus S
skill fields, and DanceMinSP. For the mercenary the engine treats healing as off
and Castling as off. The mercenary auto-casts an attack skill and self-buffs
(Quicken as the offensive buff, a guard skill as the defensive buff) but does not
heal.

## Tactics

A tactic row describes how to treat one monster class. Rows are keyed by the
monster class id. Lookup falls back in this order: the exact class row, then the
treasure-chest row for treasure classes, then the default row with id 0.

Each row has thirteen columns. The Read column shows whether the engine acts on
that column.

| # | Column | Read | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Basic | Yes | The base engagement stance. |
| 2 | Skill Use | Yes | Whether and how often to cast the attack skill. |
| 3 | Kite | No | Reference kite policy, never wired. |
| 4 | Cast React | Yes | Whether to react to the monster starting a cast. |
| 5 | Pushback | No | Pushback-skill policy. |
| 6 | Debuff | No | Debuff-skill id or status code. |
| 7 | Skill Class | No | Homunculus S skill category selector. |
| 8 | Rescue | Yes | Whether to rescue a target the monster is attacking. |
| 9 | SP Reserve | Yes | SP to keep when casting on this monster, or -1 to use the global attack skill reserve. |
| 10 | Snipe | No | Snipe policy. |
| 11 | KS | Yes | Kill-steal policy. |
| 12 | Weight | Yes | The monster weight used in the aggro count. |
| 13 | Chase | Yes | How far to chase this monster. |

Basic tactic values:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| -2 | Tank when mobbed. |
| -1 | Tank. |
| 0 | Ignore, never attack this monster. |
| 2 | Attack low, engage while HP is above the aggro threshold. |
| 3 | Attack medium. |
| 4 | Attack high. |
| 5 | React low, only defend when attacked. |
| 7 | React medium. |
| 8 | React high. |
| 9 | React self, defend only when the monster attacks the companion, not the owner. |
| 10 to 12 | Snipe variants. |
| 13 | Attack low, react medium. |
| 14 | Attack last. |
| 15 | Attack top. |

Skill Use values:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Never. |
| 100 | Always. |
| N (positive) | Cast up to N times on each target. |
| -N (negative) | Cast once at level N. |

KS values:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| -1 | Polite. |
| 0 | Never. |
| 1 | Always. |

Chase values:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| -1 | Normal. |
| 0 | Always. |
| 1 | Never. |
| 2 | Clever. |

Default tactic table: the shipped homunculus table treats plants and mushrooms as
react-only, snipes orc archers, kites drainliar and orc skeletons, ignores
treasure boxes, and attacks everything else with the default stance. The mercenary
table has a default row, a default summon row, and an auto-detect plant row.

### PVP tactics

When PVP mode is on, hostile players enter the target list and resolve their basic
and cast stance from the PVP tactic table by friend class rather than the per-mob
table. The shipped rows are: KoS attacked aggressively, Enemy and Neutral defended
when attacked, and Friend, Ally, and Retainer ignored. When PVP mode is off,
players are never targeted and monster targeting is unchanged.

## What is not implemented

- Homunculus S behavior, including combo, grapple, minion, and mob skills.
- Mercenary heal, pushback, and trap skills. A mercenary auto-casts its learned
  attack skill and self-buffs (Quicken and a guard skill), but does not heal,
  knock back, or lay traps. The reference has no mercenary heal skill either.
- The provoke and targeted-buff-into-range substate. For the four base homunculus
  classes there is no skill that needs it, since the only targeted cast is the Lif
  heal on the owner, and the server walks the caster into range for that.
- The reference AI declares an avoid monster list, a per-mob kite tactic column,
  and an idle-walk state but never wires any of them. Avoidance and idle-walk here
  implement the evident intent. Idle-walk uses a single circle wander rather than
  distinct pattern modes. The kite tactic column remains unread; the circle-strafe
  dance is driven by UseDanceAttack instead.
