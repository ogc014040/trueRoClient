//! Shared math for QuadHorn "spike" effects (ice/stone blades).
//!
//! The QuadHorn spikes all behave the same way: a blade
//! whose apex direction is set by a pitch (tilt) + yaw
//! (rotation), which rises along that direction for the first
//! few frames and then freezes, holding full alpha until a
//! short linear fade-out tail at the end of its life. FrostDiver, Grimtooth,
//! EarthSpike, IceWall and GrimToothAtk only differ in how the spikes are
//! placed and sized, so the per-spike motion lives here.
